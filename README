all to-do's in code marked with #TODO

master "to-do" list:

1. create the separate meetings, each with a unique ID, and attach to the host under created meetings. be able to render the precise meeting with its page ID.

2. allow a host to invite other users to the meeting (OK if doesn't use contacts yet), and both the meeting and account info (of the invitees) will be updated. enable meetings to show up in correct locations in home page of the users.

3. finish the meeting page, and fill in comments, motions, etc. for that meeting. enable settings option for the hosts. 

4. enable users to add comments/motions etc. enable moderators to remove content.

5. fix the styling of everything (by that I mean "actually style it"). 

6. enable contacts for a user; to search contacts in database and add by email (for now; API comes later). fix the meeting creation page to allow inviting contacts to the meeting.
