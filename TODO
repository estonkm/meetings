Functionality To-Dos

1. No "forgot your password?" functionality exists
2. "Already have an account?" on login page
3. Limit # contacts, meetings, etc. so no one can overwhelm the server
4. Handle better users leaving halfway through meeting creation--"alert! your meeting will be unsaved!" type of thing. And then delete it if they do leave.
5. For friend invites, allow multiple options of inviting--probably rewrite "invite" function to redirect users there temporarily
6. Killswitch for meetings--host should be able to "close off" at any time
7. Enable a search through contacts
8. IE9 compatibility
9. Make sure all screens still look good when user tries weird resizing
