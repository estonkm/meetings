or, BUGLIST

PENDING:


all images resize to 175x175, this is bad and it should be proportionally resizing
ensure user can't interfere with create->attach org->invite contacts
let people/companies rewrite the urls to better suit them, as long as it isn't in the system, so it isn't just random chars
no fields are strictly checked yet - like char lengths in forms vs. models vs. what people see.
no "forgot your password?" function
if inviting people to a meeting by email, no option to add them as contacts
make the user verification page look better
home page is also kinda ugly
"add a new contact" - if you don't give it an email, it silently fails
no forms are just to make sure errors are reported (no errors in prof page submit, for example)
prevent people from participating in non-open meetings
fill out the timezone options better (kinda random right now)
"remember me" is still there and still does nothing
mods have no option to provide reasons why they want to remove info
"learn more" "contact" "privacy" - all these things are just stubs.
"return to top" on home page is kinda pointless
"search existing contacts" is not implemented
"profile" and "profpage" should really not be separate pages
adding agenda items is still weird; there's no limit except for a limit of adding 10 every time you visit the page.
	mechanism also makes page jerk funny
didn't implement birthdate yet even though it's in the models (for profiles - low priority)
error page pointed to by "meeting" view not filled out (and should be implemented throughout site so we don't get 404s everywhere)
when no file chosen, "choose file" bleeds over into name and is ugly
need anonymous pictures for organizations and users (to make it look better)
replace the awkward "None"s in the profile fields with placeholders to show information format
show information in profile better (less of an awkward table)
ability to edit an organization on its page if you are the creator (maybe like...page reload to an edit mode, b/c js inputting in a table always messes stuff up)
there's no "request to add an organization" or "request to add as contact" system in place
also, "members" of organizations might be shown on the home page. a link to the organization's website would also be nice (DATABASE THING).
sideboxes need fixing up and switching - but that will come when they are tied to their pages
having south installed might be good
for inviting members to meetings, you should be able to invite people from your contacts and the system will know to just email them
contact info does not display address nor second phone number
"request entity too large" error if someone gives a picture too big
unable to edit contacts
awkward "Mr." blank or ",<>" blank in places if contact info not there - just in sideboxes
scheduled django job does not take timezones into account

FIXED:

fix title of website to be "structured meetings, etc."
time input is a select now
disallow random users from editing agenda items (lol whoops)
add "invite by email" to "manage members" in a meeting


NEW FEATURES TO ADD:

those pages link to information in the sidebars of meetings (you see a tooltip and then a "go to meeting") - also orgs are linked to page in user profile

people can click on this pages and, if they are users and not already affiliated, add them. - there are buttons on the pages but they don't do anything yet (not implemented)

COMPLETED:
user can create an organization from home or while creating meeting, and attach it to meetings
user can change and upload profile info
modal form for inviting contacts (can not be ones not in database)
profiles and organizations have viewable pages
