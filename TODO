HIGHEST PRIORITY:
-system doesn't handle timezones when determining whether or not a meeting started/is over
-"request entity too large" error if someone gives a picture too big (~ a few MB)

MORE IMPORTANT:
-ensure user can't interfere with create->attach org->invite contacts
-no fields are strictly checked yet - like char lengths in forms vs. models vs. what people see.
-no "forgot your password?" function
-no way to edit an organization (should be on-page, if you are the creator)
-no way to change organization for a meeting
-make sure errors are reported (no errors in prof page submit, for example)
-adding agenda items is still weird; there's no limit except for a limit of adding 10 every time you visit the page.
	mechanism also makes page jerk funny
-no way to edit contacts (maybe pop-up modal?)
-make a way for user to disable email notifications

LESS IMPORTANT:
-let people/companies rewrite the urls to better suit them, as long as it isn't in the system, so it isn't just random chars
-users can add contacts/organizations (or request to) from their pages
-if inviting people to a meeting by email, no option to add them as contacts
-make the user verification page look better
-"remember me" is still there and still does nothing
-mods have no option to provide reasons why they want to remove info
-"learn more" "contact" "privacy" - all these things are just stubs.
-"return to top" on home page is kinda pointless
-"search existing contacts" is not implemented
-didn't implement birthdate yet even though it's in the models
-implement a sitewide "error" page (so no 404s)
-use anonymous pictures for organizations and users (to make it look better)
-replace the awkward "None"s in the profile fields with placeholders to show information format
-show information in profile better (less of an awkward table)
-there's no "request to add an organization" or "request to add as contact" system in place
-also, "members" of organizations might be shown on the home page. 
-show link to organization's page on meeting
-contact info does not display address nor second phone number
-awkward "title" for contacts
-use google api or something for importing contacts
