or, BUGLIST

PENDING:

all images resize to 175x175, this is bad and it should be proportionally resizing
ensure user can't interfere with create->attach org->invite contacts
*add "invite by email" to "manage members" in a meeting
*disallow random users from editing agenda items (lol whoops)
let people/companies rewrite the urls to better suit them, as long as it isn't in the system, so it isn't just random chars
*fix title of website to be "structured meetings, etc."


FIXED:
