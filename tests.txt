THINGS THAT NEED TESTING - look for each location in the code, and update accordingly

refactored today:
-moved send email invites out
-moved get info from addr book import out

added today:
-hold invitations during meeting setup, invite later



general tests:

-both kinds of meetings (public, private)
-emails get sent out when I expect them to
-people have permissions that they are expected to
-meeting start/end times behave as expected, along with emails (cron)
-meeting status behaves as expected
-forms with multiple sections don't interfere
-form errors always get validated
-large numbers of comments, motions, etc. don't mess up the UI
-creating a meeting and then immediately creating another is no problem



1. mods disappear
2. adding to meeting
just the whole "manage members" page is messed up
4. mods not available to promote
5. after remove and hit "save", can't add you back in :(


fixed some bugs that occurred when motions were > 6 on page. (bug w/ editing comments, bug w/ only first collapsable showing)
